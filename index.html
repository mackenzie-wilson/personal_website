                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <br>
                <p>My current role specializes in business intelligence, developing tools that provide business analysts
                    with the ability to analyze and visualize program-based processes in real time. Additionally, a
                    subset of my
                    team
                    offers business intelligence services to other divisions on an ad hoc basis. I have also gained
                    experience in project management and predictive analytics in areas including complex asset
                    management, risk, and fraud.</p>
                <p> While my current position is rewarding and challenging, my true passion lies in building products. I
                    have always been fascinated by the process of taking an idea or concept and turning it into a
                    tangible product through design, development, and continuous improvement. The feeling of solving
                    problems and providing people with the tools they need is what drives me to transition to a
                    product-based and user-focused role. </p>
                <p>I have a strong passion for both reading and technology. Since 2014, I have completed the "52 in 52
                    challenge," reading 52 books each year. This practice has not only enriched my knowledge but has
                    also
                    sparked my creativity and provided inspiration for my projects. Speaking of projects, I constantly
                    work on side projects to explore new technologies and improve my skills. You can check out some of
                    my
                    projects on the <a id="git" href="./projects.html">Projects</a> page, where I have documented the
                    development lifecycle and provided links to their respective pages.
                </p>
                <p>If you're interested in my journey, I also write blog posts documenting the product management
                    lifecycle of each project. In these blog posts, I share insights about the lean startup process,
                    including business model design, customer development, and agile engineering. To stay updated on my
                    progress, visit the <a id="git" href="./blog.html">Blog</a> page. </p>
