                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <br>
                <p>My current role specializes in business intelligence developing tools that provide process
                    improvement
                    consultants the ability to analyze and visualize program-based processes in real time. Additionally,
                    my team offers businesss
                    intelligence services to other divisions on an ad hoc basis. I also have experience in project
                    management, risk and fraud predictive analytics,
                    and complex asset management.</p>
                <p>The most rewarding projects I have been a part of involved building tools (internal products) that
                    help make my colleague’s work lives better. While my current position is rewarding and challenging,
                    my
                    passion and aspirations lie in building products.</p>
                <p>Originally, I was aiming to break into product management to build the skills needed to realize my
                    entrepreneurial goals. Taking a more roundabout way, I’ve decided to just go ahead and start
                    building products alongside a developer as a method to hone and showcase my product management
                    expertise for potential employers.
                </p>
                <p>I will be writing posts documenting the product management lifecycle of each project, along with all
                    the books, tools,
                    and frameworks used in each of the three
                    stages of the lean startup process (business model design, customer development, and agile
                    engineering). If you would like to know where we are at in development, navigate to the <a id="git"
