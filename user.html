                    <p>"User personas are composite profiles of user needs and behaviours designed to get us out of our
                        own heads and focus on the people for whom we are truly building."</p>

                    <h3>What is a User Persona?</h3>
                    <p>"We can take the various common traits we care about in our potential customers and abstract them
                        out
                        into a persona. A persona is a fictional, typical customer, and defining key personas lets you
                        segment your customers by highlighting the things your customers care about that are relevant to
                        your product. Personas are tools to help you understand your customers, they are not actual end
                        customers" - taken from The Product Book.</p>
                    <p>Since we are in the early stages of development, we don't know much about our <em>typical
                        </em> customer and therefore must rely on assumptions. These assumptions are essentially
                        hypotheses about our users' needs and behaviours that will be tested and altered to better fit
                        reality as we continuously talk to them. The user personas will then be used to differentiate
                        who is receiving value from our product requirements through the use of user stories, a practice
                        that will be covered in the next blog post.
