                <p>CheapNite is a digital marketing platform aimed at helping users <span id="dots1"
                        class="dots">...</span>
                    <span id="more1" class="hidden">find and utilize restaurant
                        deals, specials, and promotions in their local area. Cheapnite is also a great platform
                        for
                        restaurants to promote their specials and deals to customers living in, or traveling
                        through
                        their city at an affordable price. <br><br>
                        The idea for CheapNite was born from a problem experienced by two hungry university students
                        looking for somewhere to sit down for cheap food. Finding a simple google search unfruitful,
                        they wondered why there wasn't a central spot to find local sit-down deals in their immediate
                        area. They pitched the idea to the university's startup incubator program and was accepted to
                        the cohort. Specializing in business, the two ended up seeking people for the technology side of
                        things.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the student's older brothers had just graduated with a degree in Computer Science and
                        was looking for a development project to bolster his resume and add to his portfolio.
                        Knowing I was in the same boat, he suggested we join the founding team of CheapNite to help
                        develop their product.
                        <br><br>
                        Areas I was looking to improve were my weak points whenever I was applying and interviewing for
                        poduct management roles.
                        I had a strong analytical background, done some basic design and development, but never work
                        alongside a developer and designer while influencing without authority. We figured the best way
                        for us to both benefit was to have him lead software development while I lead product, both
                        contributing to design, product management, and development in varying capacities to maximize
                        business value and communication with the business, marketing, and sales team.
